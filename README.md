# Linear_Algebra_Khan
Review of Linear Algebra playlist on Khan Academy.

The All_sections.ipynb notebook is a series of notes, user created functions, and graphs in order to review the Linear Algebra playlist on Khan Academy.

Credit to https://github.com/frnsys/ai_notes for a number of explanations and latex code. I have indicated the sections in the notebook where I quoted directly from this notebook.

# Overview of Files
1. All_sections.ipynb:
    * Includes all three sections (Vectors & Spaces, Matrix Transformations, Alternative coordinate systems) of the Khan Academy playlist

2. [User created functions](#User-created-functions):
    * Python:
        - vector.py, projection.py, graph_multiple.py, Change_basis.py, Notebook_functions.py, OOP_all_functions.py
    * Python notebook
        - Notebook_functions.ipynb, OOP_all_functions.ipynb

3. Screenshots
    * Screenshots of notes pasted into the All_sections.ipynb Notebook_functions

4. Gifs showing 3-d matplotlib of:
    1. Change of basis
    2. Cross product
    3. Left Null and Row Space
